# ImpostorHQ-Requiem
From one of the authors of [ImpostorHQ](https://github.com/dimaguy/ImpostorHQ), ImpostorHQ-Requiem is the ultimate plugin to get useful information out of your [Impostor Server](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor)  
IHQ-R's main goal is to provide an API which empowers users to create their own useful webpages, be them private or public.  
Some sample page extensions are provided to help developers get a hold of the API
